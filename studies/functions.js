/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 
 * 0. A function is an integral part of the core foundation of the Javascript language.
 * Functions are named variables which contain code blocks. The code contained inside
 * of a function acts as a set of instructions or steps to take. Functions are used
 * to perform actions and/or calculates a value. Functions can optionally return
 * values, but this is not necessary for its *functionality*(<<Lol). After a function
 * is created, it can be used, or called, by typing the function's name, followed
 * by a pair of parentheses.
 * 
 * 1. To create a function, the keyword "function" is used, followed by a chosen name
 * which will be used to put it into action. Following the name, a pair of parentheses
 * whithin which optional parameters can be included. Lastly a pair of curly braces 
 * containing the instructional code block. The syntax is as follows:
 * 
 * function <function-name> (<parameter1>, <parameter2>) {
 *    <code-to-run>
 *      <optional-return-statement>
 *  }
 * 
 * 2. In order to use variables which are declared and initialized on the global scope
 * and outside of the function scope, parameters must be included when the function
 * is created. When the function is called, if the function declaration contains parameters
 * the variables passed in are called arguments. After the function's name, the arguments
 * are housed within the parentheses, separated by commas. The syntax of a function call
 * is as follows:
 * 
 * <function-name>(<argument1>, <argument2>);
 * 
 * 3.
